        <h5>Don't give away what you have.</h5>.</span>

        <p>Know What God is to you.Kow What He's done for you.</p>

        <p style="font-size:20px;color:white; font-family:impact;">Now as Christian are job is to not be like the people in 2Timothy 3:7.<br>
          "Ever learning, and never coming to the full knowledge of christ."<br>
          Only Qaulified people, who come into the full knowledge of Christ,<br>
          will have a chance to make it.People in the natural government <br>
          would not able to be there if they did not experience.<br>
          Now as Christian it is time to learn all that we need to become a part of the bride of Christ. </p>

        <p style="font-size:20px;color:white; font-family:impact;" >The message continue:<br><br>
        God took us from four point of the earth as it mention in the book of Luke 13:29 .<br>
        He went on, to show we can find the Lord, through faith. In Matthew 8:6-7.<br> The servant went to find Jesus Christ by faith and humble before Him.<br> Brother Noel<br>
        Went on back to the same topic. of 2 Timothy 3 <br> 
        <strong style="color:blue;font-size:25px;">Things we should not</strong><br>
        "For men shall be lovers of their own selves".
        <ul style="font-size:20px;color:black; font-family:impact;">
          <li> covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, </li><br>
          <li> disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,</li><br>
                   <li> Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers</li><br> 
                   <li>incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,</li><br>
                   <li> Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;</li> <br>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p  style="font-size:22px;color:white; font-family:impact;">
         Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.<br>
          For of this sort are they which creep into houses,<br>
        and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,<br>
        the faith  of the religion world is set on natural things; houses, money, cars.<br>
         but as Christain is set on above. that is why we should strive daily <br>
         and always ask God to help us on the way.<br>
         Ask for His strenght, strenght for your mind, spirit <br>
         and so you won't do your own will but God's.<strong>God Bless</strong>
